# Module ppmt
Software to streamline processing of the DFO thermograph network data in the Gulf of 
St. Lawrence (Qu√©bec region).

## History
The Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) supports the Atlantic Zone Monitoring
Program (AZMP), in the context of which a network of coastal temperature and salinity sensors
(referred to here as thermographs) are being deployed on an annual basis at the same locations.
Beginning in 1993, this initiative pre-dates the AZMP but is now integrated into its operations.

Several data analysts have been responsible for the quality assurance and quality control of
the thermograph data over the years, each using their own set of tools, but these are often
not transferable to the next data analyst because of software license and tool documentation
issues. The objective of this module is to provide a reusable tool in a centralized location
such that maintenance of this program is less affected by employee turnover and mobility.

## Module installation
The intended use of this module is to be cloned onto a DFO work computer connected to the
DFO local network either on site or through VPN, and used either from command line or inside
an IDE.

## Workflow
